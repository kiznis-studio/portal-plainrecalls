      <h1>About PlainRecalls</h1>
      <p>
        PlainRecalls is a free product recall search engine that aggregates recall data
        from multiple U.S. federal agencies into one easy-to-search database.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>FDA (Food and Drug Administration)</strong> — Food, drug, and medical device enforcement actions</li>
        <li><strong>CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission)</strong> — Consumer product recalls</li>
        <li><strong>NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)</strong> — Vehicle safety recalls</li>
        <li><strong>USDA FSIS (Food Safety and Inspection Service)</strong> — Meat and poultry recalls</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        We pull recall data directly from official government APIs and databases, normalize it
        into a consistent format, and make it searchable by product, company, agency, category,
        and date. Our database is updated regularly to include the latest recalls.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        PlainRecalls is not affiliated with any U.S. government agency. While we strive to
        present accurate recall information, always verify with the official source before
        making safety decisions. Data is provided "as is" for informational purposes.
